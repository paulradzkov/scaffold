# Scaffold

Experiment with project file-structure and documentation. With static sites in mind.

## What I want to build

It is a template for a site with components documentation.

## Gulp tasks

`gulp clean` — delete `public` folder.  
`gulp rendercss` — prepare css files.  
`gulp watcher` — watch changes and recompile.

`gulp build` — clean and build project.  
`gulp dev` — clean, build and watch.  
`gulp` — same as build.
